I am an amateur programmer, doing it as hobby and I try to use my limited skills to create simple games and apps. My knowledge comes from sources available to everyone and there is still much to learn.

I'm glad you got interested in this project, any feedback welcome!

I created Ancient Battles on my own using free and widely available resources.
The game was written in C++ using Allegro 5 framework.
The graphics were created in Paint and GIMP2.
The music was edited in Ashampoo Music Studio 2016.
Sounds come from the internet.
The music comes from http://freemusicarchive.org
