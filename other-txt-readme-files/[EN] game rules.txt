Ancient Battles is a 2D digital board game in hotseat game mode.

The rules are as simple as in a traditional board game. 2, 3 or 4 players can participate in a single battle. There are four pawn colors:
 - player 1 - RED
 - player 2 - GREEN
 - player 3 - YELLOW
 - player 4 - BLUE
Before the battle, players should determine moving order. Pawn colors indicate moving order as shown above.

Moving consists of two things: clicking on the dice in the left bottom corner and clicking on the value that appeared on the screen.

The dice is four-sided, which means you can roll 1, 2, 3 or 4.

The battle arena consists of 40 squares, while START has number 0 and FINISH - number 39. There are traps (which make a pawn move backwards or return to start) and some special squares that help (which make a pawn move forward). Tread carefully! The first player to reach FINISH is the winner.

Gather your buddies and play, glory awaits!
